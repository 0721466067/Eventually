Eventually
==========
An Arduino Event-based Programming Library
------------------------------------------

Arduino programming is a bit of a bait-and-switch.  At first, people are like, "look, it's super-easy - see my blink program!"  Then, when it comes to writing anything with even the most minute complexity - with states and input and output - one has to switch to a horrid event-programming mindset with thousands of state variables everywhere.

The goal of Eventually is to make a more event-oriented environment for Arduino programming.  To make it *actually* easy to use to build worthwhile projects.
